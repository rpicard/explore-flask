# Release notes

This is version 0.01 of *Explore Flask*. This version consists of the first 7 chapters of what will be the final book.

I'm going to be updating things and adding chapters to the release as they come. I'm hoping that by releasing early and iterating on a public project I'll be able to incorporate reader feedback into this before I release version 1.0.

Once I reach 1.0 I'll make the book available in print editions, convert to other formats and do all of the other polishing up that is expected of a published book. For now though, I present a rough version of the final book.

With that said, I'm waiting until I feel like each chapter is ready before including them in a release, even an early one. The content of the book so far isn't in the first draft state, but it's not quite finished either. It still needs some polishing up.

In 0.01 there are still a lot of questions of formatting. Informational boxes, tables and images aren't in their final form. There are some author's notes left throughout as well.

If you have feedback, the book is being developed openly on GitHub: https://github.com/rpicard/explore-flask. I welcome bug reports and pull requests. You can also send me an email at robert@exploreflask.com.

I hope that despite it's rough state, you'll still enjoy the content of *Explore Flask*.

## Thank you

First of all, I'd like to say thank you to my volunteer editor, Will Kahn-Greene. He's been great about going over my very rough drafts and helping me decide on the scope and direction of the content.

Another big thanks to everyone who took the time to talk with me about how they are using Flask. This includes Armin Ronacher (Flask creator), Mark Harviston (Elsevier), Glenn Yonemitsu (Markup Hive), Andy Parsons (Happify), Oleg Lavrovsky (Apps with love), Joel Anderson (Cloudmancer) and Mahmoud Abdelkader (Balanced).
